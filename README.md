## aws-ranger

**WIP**<br>
Some features are not fully operational yet

The tool to help you get a handle on your AWS account.

To start using just type: `aws-ranger --init`.<br>
This will prompt for your AWS creds and account alias of your choice and map your entire account.

You later could run it again but with an action: `stop, start` OR `terminate`

#### Install
`pip install https://github.com/maimon33/aws-ranger/archive/master.zip`

#### Basic usage
* get current state
```
$ aws-ranger

    "ap-northeast-1": {}, 
    "ap-northeast-2": {}, 
    "ap-south-1": {}, 
    "ap-southeast-1": {}, 
    "ap-southeast-2": {}, 
    "ca-central-1": {},

    "us-east-1": {}, 
    "us-east-2": {}, 
    "us-west-1": {}, 
    "us-west-2": {}
}
```
* terminate instances without protected tags
```
$ aws-ranger -x terminate
